# iCUETempGraphTool
### Note I, and this tool I have made is not related to Corsair in any way, I'm just somebody who wanted an easy way to graph things like this.
Takes a CSV file from Corsair iCUE and creates a graph out of it.

# How to use
(This applies for Corsair iCUE version 5.5, not sure about other ones.)

1. Open Corsair iCUE and go to Settings
2. Go to Sensor Logging and turn it on
3. Select the desired devices to monitor and export tempurature from (I think you might also be able to use the fans too, and it will create a graph of the fan speed.)
4. Select the output directory <br>
5. Wait a while for it to monitor, once you are ready, run the script and select the CSV file and the folder to output the PNGs to.
6. You are done.
